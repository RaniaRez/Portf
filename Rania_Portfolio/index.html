		<h1>Who am I</h1>
		<p>Meet me, a fourth-year  intelligent systems student at the Higher National school for Computer Science ESI Algiers, Algeria. 
            <br>
        With a passion for data science and AI, I'm always eager to learn more about the field and explore its applications. 
        Throughout my studies, I have gained a strong foundation in statistical modeling, 
        machine learning, and deep learning techniques, and have applied them to real-world problems in various projects. <br>
        I'm dedicated to using my skills and knowledge to make a positive impact in the world through AI and data-driven solutions.</p>
